# 1. Summary of the Review process and scope

## 1.1 Process

Our review was conducted in two distinct phases, which we review to as initial and final reviews. The initial phase looked at the contract system code as it was provided to us by 0x upon commencement. The final review looked at the system code after our recommendations were incorporated. Thus each issue has a note about the **resolution**, and our assessment of it.  (Some fixes were incomplete and other improvements were recommended, so the final review was extended to August 3 as will be described.)

July 3: review begins (with 1 ConsenSys Diligence member and others ramping up each of the following 2 weeks) on
https://github.com/0xProject/contracts/tree/888d5a02573572240f4c55e03238be603c13c469

July 21: A mid-report, consisting of most of the findings in this report, is presented to the 0x team.

July 28: 0x team presented the following updated system, which ConsenSys Diligence used to report resolutions:
https://github.com/0xProject/contracts/tree/e51d4dcb4c8e0d93815e9d2a5c511d60ce017870

It was discovered that some fixes were incomplete, as well as other improvements recommended, and on August 3, the 0x team presented, for the purposes of this report, the final system:
https://github.com/0xProject/contracts/tree/74728c404a1c7e9091074bd88abf454fd374228a

## 1.2 Scope

### Source codeÂ 

The code base reviewed was in the [0xProject/contracts](https://github.com/0xProject/contracts/tree/888d5a02573572240f4c55e03238be603c13c469) repository, with commit hash `888d5a02573572240f4c55e03238be603c13c469`.

Revisions made after the initial review, can be found in the `frozenUpdated` branch at commit hash `74728c404a1c7e9091074bd88abf454fd374228a`.

### Documentation

0x provided ConsenSys Diligence with the following documentation:

* The [0x Project Whitepaper](https://0xproject.com/pdfs/0x_white_paper.pdf)
* The [README](https://github.com/0xProject/contracts/blob/master/README.md) file for the [0xProject/contracts](https://github.com/0xProject/contracts/tree/frozen) repository.

### Dynamic tests

The pre-existing tests for [0xProject/contracts](https://github.com/0xProject/contracts/tree/frozen) repository were executed using the truffle framework, run against contracts deployed on a local instance of testrpc.

In order for the tests to succeed, the module `ethereumjs-testrpc` had to be uninstalled and reinstalled specifying version `3.0.2`.

```
$ npm uninstall -g ethereumjs-testrpc
$ npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc@3.0.2
```

The revised code base now includes the script `npm run testrpc`,

### Review Goals

0x contracted ConsenSys Diligence to review the codebase for the following properties:

**Security**: identification of security related issues within each
contract and within the system of contracts.

**Sound Architecture**: evaluation of the architecture of this system through the lens of established smart contract best practices and general software best practices.

**Code Correctness and Quality**:
A full review of the contract source code.  The primary areas of focus include:

* Correctness (does it do what it is supposed to do)
* Readability (how easily it can be read and understood)
* Sections of code with high complexity
* Improving scalability
* Quantity and quality of test coverage
